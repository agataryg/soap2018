VFON-2902
Rationale behind the changes:
- A few times I changed both heading and link text, mainly to make the text more concise
- I left "About" only in the 1st heading (About chatting), otherwise it could be confused with a procedure due to the use of gerund
- I changed "About friends" to "Friends list" to get rid of the philosophical connotations :)
